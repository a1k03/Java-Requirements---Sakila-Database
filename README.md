# Java-Requirements---Sakila-Database
Using SQL to query the Sakila database and then using Java to return that output from the database. This was all done within the Eclipse IDE.


This was apart of my university coursework, in which we were allocated unique requirement sets and had to complete these requirements by using SQL and Java. 
I did 3 of 4 requirements at the time. These included : 

- Find the total number of actors
- Find the customer who is the most frequent
- List top ten customers by revenue
